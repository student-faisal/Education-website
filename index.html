    <p class="sectionsubTag  text-small"> Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. There are many types of education. 
        Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but takes place outside
         the formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into 
         levels. They include early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching
          method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can also be disti nguished by subject, like science education, language
           education, and physical education. The term "education" can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people and the academic field studying 
           educational phenomena.

    <p class="sectionsubTag  text-small">The precise definition of education is disputed and there are disagreements about what the aims of education are and to what
         extent education is different from indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of 
         education. Fundamentally, education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become 
         productive members of society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions affect many 
         aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies to determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend.
          International organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children.

    <p class="sectionsubTag  text-small"> Many factors influence whether education is successful. Psychological factors include motivation, 
        intelligence, and personality. Social factors, like socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender, are often linked to discrimination. 
        Further factors include access to educational technology, teacher quality, and parent involvement.

        The main field investigating education is called education studies. It examines what education is, what aims and effects it has, 
        and how to improve it. Education studies has many subfields, like philosophy of education, psychology of education, sociology of 
        education, economics of education, and comparative education. It also discusses the history of education. In prehistory, education
         happened informally through oral communication and imitation. With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was invented, and the 
         amount of knowledge grew. This caused a shift from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was mainly available to
          elites and religious groups. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century made books more widely available. 
          This increased general literacy. Beginning in the 18th and 19th centuries, public education became more important. 
          It led to the worldwide process of making primary education available to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age.
